# **WHERE TO FOODðŸŒ®**

**WHERE TO FOOD** is a **web scraping** based project that lists the restaurants available on **zomato**, with the restaurant with higher **rating** and more **offer** being listed at the top.

It calculates a score of the restaurant using the rating and offer provided by the restaurant. Higher the rating and offer, higher the score will be. The listing of the restaurants is done based on this score calculated.

It helps me save time in searching for a restaurant and also saves my money as I get restaurants with good offers listed at the top.

Also it has two option for **Online Order** and **Dine Out** restaurants. I can select what list I want to see.

I also get some info about the restaurant such as it's **category** and **open timings** of the restaurant.
But the best thing is that it also gives the **direct link to the restaurant's order page on zomato** so i can simply order by clicking on the link instead of searching for the restaurant manually.

## INPUTS

User can give **1** as input for **dine out** options and **2** for **online order** options.
