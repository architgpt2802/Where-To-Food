# **WHERE TO FOODðŸŒ®**

**WHERE TO FOOD** is a **web scraping** based project that lists the restaurants available on **zomato**, with the restaurant with higher **rating** and more **offer** being listed at the top.

It calculates a score of the restaurant using the rating and offer provided by the restaurant. Higher the rating and offer, higher the score will be. The listing of the restaurants is done based on this score calculated.

It helps me save time in searching for a restaurant and also saves my money as I get restaurants with good offers listed at the top.

Also it has two option for **Online Order** and **Dine Out** restaurants. I can select what list I want to see.

There is also a third option **Suggest Me** which using **Machine Learning** can recommend me the category of food I may like to have.

I also get some info about the restaurant such as it's **category** and **open timings** of the restaurant.
But the best thing is that it also gives the **direct link to the restaurant's order page on zomato** so i can simply order by clicking on the link instead of searching for the restaurant manually.


## SMS ALERT

I have also added a feature that **automatically alerts me via a text SMS** whenever a restauraunt is providing an awesome deal. **So now i never miss any _steal deal_**.

The system checkes for the offers after every hour and if the score is above 120(say) then it sends a sms at my phone number and notify me for a great deal.
I don't even need to run the script as it automatically notifies me on my phone.

For the sms alerts, I am using [**TWILIO**](https://www.twilio.com/) messaging service (NOTE: I am using a trial version). I use **API** for interaction with the twilio website.

## SUGGEST ME

Sometimes it is even difficult to choose what you want to order. There comes the **Suggest Me** option which uses ML to recommend me what I may like to have based on my previous order history.

The independent variables are is it a Weekday or Weekend and it's Breakfast or Lunch or Dinner I am ordering for.
Then using **Logistic Regression**, it predicts the category of food and lists the restaurants where that category of food is available.

## CONF.PY

conf.py is a file that contains **credentials** for sms fuctionality such **API keys and auth tokens for twilio and phone numbers of recipients and my twilio phone number**.
This information should never be shared and are private. So i have not commited these files to github repository.

#### SCRIPT IN CONF.PY

```python
account_sid = 'my twilio account sid'

auth_token = 'my twilio account auth token'

twilio_num = 'my twilio phn number'

my_num = 'my phone number'
```
